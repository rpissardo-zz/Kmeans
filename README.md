# Kmeans
Coding a kmeans code that read a database with 4 attributes and n classes.

I am using, 3 datasets. 

## cancer.data
- has 2 classes

## arrythmia.data
- has 16 classes

## iris.data
- has 3 classes

## Number of Clusters

So, because of numbers above, I choose to generate three graphs with 2, 3, and 16 clusters.

# Datasets

All datas were downloaded from UCI repository:
  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=taskUp&view=table

# Algorithm

Based on:
